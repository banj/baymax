# Moody

A ruby script to quiz you on your feelings using the `Profile of Mood States` and store the results as a csv with time objects for convenient manipulation.

Currently uses the Short Form of the test (`POMS-SF`).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for the original longer-form test
- [ ] Allow user to choose which version they prefer
- [ ] Automate some statistics and provide a report
